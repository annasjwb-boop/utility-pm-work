**AI Processing (visible to user):**
```
🔍 Analyzing fleet health predictions...
   ✓ Evaluated 50 vessels
   ✓ Found 7 requiring major maintenance in Q2
   
📊 Cross-referencing project schedules...
   ✓ Analyzed 15 active projects
   ✓ Identified critical vessel dependencies
   
🛠️ Optimizing maintenance windows...
   ✓ Checked 23 port facilities
   ✓ Verified spare parts availability
   ✓ Matched crew certifications
   
💡 Generating optimal schedule...
```

**AI Response:**
"I've identified 7 vessels requiring major maintenance in Q2. Here's the optimal schedule:

**Critical Priority:**
- **Vessel 3** (Main engine overhaul) - April 8-15 in Dubai
  - Project X completes April 6
  - Parts arrive April 5
  - Certified engineer available
  - Weather window: optimal
  - Cost: $185K | Downtime: 7 days
  
- **Vessel 12** (Crane hydraulic system) - May 2-8 in Abu Dhabi
  - Between Project Y and Project Z
  - 6-day buffer available
  - Cost: $140K | Downtime: 6 days

**Standard Priority:**
- Vessels 7, 18, 23 - June scheduling (details below)

**Deferred (Low Risk):**
- Vessels 9, 15 - Can safely defer to Q3

**Total Q2 Maintenance:**
- Cost: $780K (vs $1.2M if emergency)
- Project impact: Zero delays
- Utilization maintained: 87%

Would you like to see alternative scheduling scenarios or approve this plan?"

**User Follow-up:**
"What if we delay Vessel 3 by 2 weeks?"

**AI Instant Response:**
"Delaying Vessel 3's maintenance to April 22-29 would:

⚠️ **Risks:**
- 34% probability of failure before April 22
- Jeopardizes Project W start (April 20)
- Emergency repair cost estimate: $320K
- Potential project delay: 3 days ($450K penalty)

✅ **Benefits:**
- None significant

💡 **Recommendation:** Maintain April 8-15 schedule. The risk far outweighs any scheduling convenience."

```

### AI Integration Best Practices:
```
Claude API usage:
- System prompt defines maritime operations context
- Include vessel/fleet data in user messages
- Use structured output when needed (JSON)
- Implement streaming for better UX
- Add error handling and fallbacks
- Cache common queries
- Rate limiting considerations

Example system prompt:
"You are an AI assistant for NEXUS Maritime, a fleet operations platform. 
You help operations managers, captains, and maintenance engineers make 
optimal decisions about vessel operations, maintenance, and safety. 
You have access to real-time data about vessels, equipment health, 
weather conditions, and project schedules. Always provide specific, 
actionable recommendations with clear reasoning."

Context injection:
- Current vessel details (if focused on one)
- Recent alerts
- Ongoing projects
- Weather conditions
- User role and permissions
```

### Performance Considerations:
```
Optimization priorities:

1. Real-time updates:
   - Use WebSocket for live data
   - Throttle high-frequency updates
   - Only update changed values
   - Virtual scrolling for long lists

2. 3D rendering:
   - Use Level of Detail (LOD) for models
   - Frustum culling
   - Limit draw calls
   - GPU instancing for repeated elements

3. Data fetching:
   - React Query for caching
   - Prefetch likely next views
   - Pagination for large datasets
   - Compress API responses

4. State management:
   - Zustand for global state
   - React context for local state
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders
   - Memoize expensive computations
```

### Testing Approach:
```
Priority tests:

1. Unit tests (Jest):
   - Utility functions
   - Data transformations
   - API clients

2. Component tests (React Testing Library):
   - User interactions
   - Conditional rendering
   - Form submissions

3. Integration tests:
   - API endpoints
   - Database operations
   - WebSocket connections

4. E2E tests (Playwright):
   - Critical user flows
   - Demo scenarios
   - Cross-browser compatibility

Start with happy paths, add edge cases later
```

### Deployment Preparation:
```

1. Environment variables:
   - API keys (Claude, Mapbox, weather)
   - Database URLs
   - Feature flags

2. Docker containers:
   - Frontend (Nginx serving static build)
   - Backend (Node/Python service)
   - Database (PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB)
   - Redis cache

3. CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions):
